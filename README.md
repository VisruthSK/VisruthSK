## Hello

I am a statistics and data science student at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.

I'm interested in computational statistics, functional programming, & HPC.

I mostly work in R and sometimes use Julia and Python. I'm slowly learning OCaml and and want to learn C/C++.

### Books I'm reading/read with very rough notes:
- [Category Theory for Programmers](https://github.com/VisruthSK/Category-Theory-for-Programmers)
- [OCaml Programming: Correct + Efficient + Beautiful](https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/cover.html)
  - Currently on hold as I want to use notebooks but [OCaml Jupyter](https://github.com/akabe/ocaml-jupyter) doesn't work with OCaml 5.
- [Advanced R, 2e](https://github.com/VisruthSK/STAT400-F24)

### Favorite blogs:
- [Nikhil Suresh](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/)
  - A must read! 
- [Andrew Gelman et al.](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/)
- [Vicki Boykis](https://vickiboykis.com/)
- [Matt Might](https://matt.might.net/articles/)
- [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/)

Reccomendations appreciated!
