## Hello!

I am a statistics and data science student at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.

I'm interested in computational statistics/statistical learning, Bayesian statistics, & stochastics. I'm also interested in functional programming, & HPC.

I mostly work in R and sometimes use Julia and Python. I'm slowly learning OCaml and want to learn C/C++.
