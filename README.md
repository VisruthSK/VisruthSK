## Hello!

I am a statistics and data science student at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.

My research interests are broadly Bayesian and skew toward computational methods and modeling. I’m interested in problems at the intersection of Bayesian statistics and statistical learning, such as Bayesian nonparametrics, variational inference.

I mostly work in R and sometimes use Julia and Python. I'm slowly learning Rust and OCaml, and generally like functional languages.
